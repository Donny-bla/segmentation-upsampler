	abstract = {Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) has emerged as a promising technique for non-invasive neuromodulation, but current systems lack the precision to target deep brain structures effectively. Here, we introduce an advanced TUS system that achieves unprecedented precision in deep brain neuromodulation. The system features a 256-element, helmet-shaped transducer array operating at 555 kHz, coupled with a stereotactic positioning system, individualised treatment planning, and real-time monitoring using functional MRI. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the system{\textquoteright}s ability to selectively modulate the activity of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and its functionally connected regions in the visual cortex. Participants exhibited significantly increased visual cortex activity during concurrent TUS and visual stimulation, with high reproducibility across individuals. Moreover, a theta-burst TUS protocol induced robust neuromodulatory effects, with decreased visual cortex activity observed for at least 40 minutes post-stimulation. These neuromodulatory effects were specific to the targeted LGN, as confirmed by control experiments. Our findings highlight the potential of this advanced TUS system to non-invasively modulate deep brain circuits with high precision and specificity, offering new avenues for studying brain function and developing targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The unprecedented spatial resolution and prolonged neuromodulatory effects demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology for both research and clinical applications, paving the way for a new era of non-invasive deep brain neuromodulation.Competing Interest StatementBET, EM, OW, and MR are authors of or have a financial interest in patent filings related to the technology described in this study.

    abstract = {Computational models of acoustic wave propagation are frequently used in transcranial ultrasound therapy, for example, to calculate the intracranial pressure field or to calculate phase delays to correct for skull distortions. To allow intercomparison between the different modeling tools and techniques used by the community, an international working group was convened to formulate a set of numerical benchmarks. Here, these benchmarks are presented, along with intercomparison results. Nine different benchmarks of increasing geometric complexity are defined. These include a single-layer planar bone immersed in water, a multi-layer bone, and a whole skull. Two transducer configurations are considered (a focused bowl and a plane piston operating at 500 kHz), giving a total of 18 permutations of the benchmarks. Eleven different modeling tools are used to compute the benchmark results. The models span a wide range of numerical techniques, including the finite-difference time-domain method, angular spectrum method, pseudospectral method, boundary-element method, and spectral-element method. Good agreement is found between the models, particularly for the position, size, and magnitude of the acoustic focus within the skull. When comparing results for each model with every other model in a cross-comparison, the median values for each benchmark for the difference in focal pressure and position are less than 10\% and 1 mm, respectively. The benchmark definitions, model results, and intercomparison codes are freely available to facilitate further comparisons.},

title = {Strategies and safety simulations for ultrasonic cervical spinal cord neuromodulation},
journal = {Physics in Medicine & Biology},
abstract = {Objective. Focused ultrasound spinal cord neuromodulation has been demonstrated in small animals. However, most of the tested neuromodulatory exposures are similar in intensity and exposure duration to the reported small animal threshold for possible spinal cord damage. All efforts must be made to minimize the risk and assure the safety of potential human studies, while maximizing potential treatment efficacy. This requires an understanding of ultrasound propagation and heat deposition within the human spine. Approach. Combined acoustic and thermal modelling was used to assess the pressure and heat distributions produced by a 500 kHz source focused to the C5/C6 level via two approaches (a) the posterior acoustic window between vertebral posterior arches, and (b) the lateral intervertebral foramen from which the C6 spinal nerve exits. Pulse trains of fifty 0.1 s pulses (pulse repetition frequency: 0.33 Hz, free-field spatial peak pulse-averaged intensity: 10 W cm−2) were simulated for four subjects and for ±10 mm translational and ±10∘ rotational source positioning errors. Main results. Target pressures ranged between 20%–70% of free-field spatial peak pressures with the posterior approach, and 20%–100% with the lateral approach. When the posterior source was optimally positioned, peak spine heating values were below 1 ∘C, but source mispositioning resulted in bone heating up to 4 ∘C. Heating with the lateral approach did not exceed 2 ∘C within the mispositioning range. There were substantial inter-subject differences in target pressures and peak heating values. Target pressure varied three to four-fold between subjects, depending on approach, while peak heating varied approximately two-fold between subjects. This results in a nearly ten-fold range between subjects in the target pressure achieved per degree of maximum heating. Significance. This study highlights the utility of trans-spine ultrasound simulation software and need for precise source-anatomy positioning to assure the subject-specific safety and efficacy of focused ultrasound spinal cord therapies.}

    abstract = { Non-invasive, focal neurostimulation with ultrasound is a potentially powerful neuroscientific tool that requires effective transcranial focusing of ultrasound to develop. Time-reversal (TR) focusing using numerical simulations of transcranial ultrasound propagation can correct for the effect of the skull, but relies on accurate simulations. Here, focusing requirements for ultrasonic neurostimulation are established through a review of previously employed ultrasonic parameters, and consideration of deep brain targets. The specific limitations of finite-difference time domain (FDTD) and k-space corrected pseudospectral time domain (PSTD) schemes are tested numerically to establish the spatial points per wavelength and temporal points per period needed to achieve the desired accuracy while minimizing the computational burden. These criteria are confirmed through convergence testing of a fully simulated TR protocol using a virtual skull. The k-space PSTD scheme performed as well as, or better than, the widely used FDTD scheme across all individual error tests and in the convergence of large scale models, recommending it for use in simulated TR. Staircasing was shown to be the most serious source of error. Convergence testing indicated that higher sampling is required to achieve fine control of the pressure amplitude at the target than is needed for accurate spatial targeting. },

Model selection in this class of SVMs involves two hyper parameters: the penalty parameter C and the kernel width σ. This letter analyzes the behavior of the SVM classifier when these hyper parameters take very small or very large values. Our results help in understanding the hyperparameter space that leads to an efficient heuristic method of searching for hyperparameter values with small generalization errors. The analysis also indicates that if complete model selection using the gaussian kernel has been conducted, there is no need to consider linear SVM.},
