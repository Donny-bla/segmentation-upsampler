# Segmentation Upsampler

This is a Python-based software for upsampling segmented images using a mesh-based method. This method aims to reduce the staircasing artifact and increase ultrasound simulation accuracy.

## Installation

*The software is Python-based and MATLAB is used to generate sample shapes and run tests.

The software was developed in following environment:\
Python version 3.9\
MATLAB R2023b\
To use a lateral version of Python, please check the compatibility using this link: https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html.


Python package Installation:\
pip install numpy scipy vtk numba

MATLAB package:\
k-Wave (http://www.k-wave.org/)

## Examples

[example_multilabel_testobject.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/example_multilabel_testobject.m) upsamples a code-generated complex shape and compares it to a high-resolution ground truth.

[example_vertebra.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/example_vertebra.m) upsamples a medical image-based segementation of a spine. Figure 1 demonstrates the upsampling of a multi-label spine segmentation with input parameters $\sigma = 0.7$ and isovalue = 0.4. The input image is sourced from Liebl $et$ $al$. 2021 [^1]. This demonstration resamples the original anisotropic voxel spacing of [0.2910, 0.2910, 1.2500] millimetres to an isotropic [0.8, 0.8, 0.8] millimetre voxel spacing.

[example_AustinWoman_Kidney.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/example_AustinWoman_Kidney.m) is another example that upsamples a segmented medical image. Figure 2 illustrates another example of an upsampled multi-label medical image with input parameters $\sigma = 0.4$ and isovalue = 0.4, showcasing a liver obtained from the female Visible Human Project dataset [^2]. This demonstration upsamples the original voxel spacing of [1, 1, 1] millimetres to an isotropic [0.8, 0.8, 0.8] millimetre voxel spacing..

## Test

[MultilabelGridSearch.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/MultilabelGridSearch.m) provides a grid-search method to find optimal parameter settings for upsampling an object with a code-based high-resolution ground truth. 

[methodComparsion.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/methodComparsion.m) provides a comparsion of the mesh-based upsampling method against naive (nearest-neighbour and trilinear interpolation) upsampling methods.

[normalizationomparsion.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/normalizationComparsion.m) compares error metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the upsampled result using a high-resolution ground truth.

[IsovalueVSVolume.m](https://github.com/ucl-bug/segmentation-upsampler/blob/main/IsovalueVSVolume.m) provides the variation of volume ratio against isovalue, which can be used by the user to select the isovalue based on the desired volume.
